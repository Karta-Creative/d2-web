D2 Health Club – Terms and Conditions
Last Updated: [Date]

Welcome to D2 Health Club (the “App”). This App is owned and operated by KARTA CREATIVE LTD, a company registered in England and Wales with its registered office at 167-169 Great Portland Street, 5th Floor, London, England, W1W 5PF (referred to herein as “we,” “us,” or “our”).

By downloading, accessing, installing, or using the App, you (the “User” or “you”) agree to be bound by these Terms and Conditions (the “Terms”). If you do not agree with these Terms, you must not use the App.

1. Scope of These Terms
1.1 Acceptance of Terms
These Terms govern your use of the App and any associated features and services (collectively, the “Services”). By using the App, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by these Terms.

1.2 Additional Terms and Policies
From time to time, additional terms and conditions may apply to certain features or services offered within the App. In the event of a conflict between these Terms and any additional terms, the additional terms shall prevail solely with respect to the conflicting subject matter.

1.3 Age Requirement
The App is currently intended for individuals who are at least 18 years of age (or the age of majority in your jurisdiction). By registering for or using the App, you represent that you meet this requirement. We do not actively discourage minors from downloading the App, but the App is not designed or marketed for their use.

2. App Functionality and Beta Disclaimer
2.1 Primary Purpose

The core function of the App is to help you track your daily steps and encourage you to reach individually set step goals.
You may connect and compare your step stats with friends on a leaderboard.
You may also link the App to certain gaming accounts so you can occasionally receive in-game rewards—such as items or boosts—if you achieve specific step goals or maintain streaks.
2.2 Individual Use and Friends Integration

The App is designed primarily for individual use but also allows you to connect with friends and compare step data.
There is currently no feature for posting user-generated content (e.g., photos, forum posts, comments).
2.3 Beta Status

The App is in an early closed beta stage. Features may change, and there may be bugs, errors, or interruptions in service. We reserve the right to modify or discontinue the App (or any part of it) without prior notice.
3. Third-Party Integrations and In-Game Rewards
3.1 Step Data Sources

The App retrieves step counts from third-party health platforms, such as Apple Health (iOS) and Google Health Connect (Android).
We do not guarantee the accuracy or reliability of data from these third-party sources.
3.2 Gaming Accounts and Rewards

In order to receive sporadic in-game rewards, you may connect your gaming account(s) to the App.
We are not responsible for any issues related to those third-party gaming platforms, including their own terms of service, reward availability, or the crediting of rewards to your gaming account.
Rewards are not guaranteed and may vary based on your location, your step activity, partnership arrangements, or other factors.
4. User Accounts and Data
4.1 Account Creation

To access certain features, including leaderboards and gaming rewards, you must register for an account.
You agree to provide accurate, current, and complete information as prompted by the App’s registration forms, and to keep that information updated.
4.2 Personal Data Collected

We currently collect your email address, daily step goal, and step count information (including your total step count since registering).
We do not collect sensitive health metrics such as heart rate, BMI, or medical conditions.
4.3 Data Storage & Security

Your data is stored on servers located in the EU. We use Supabase as our authentication and database provider.
Only senior technical members of our team have account permissions to access the database. We take reasonable security measures to protect your personal data; however, no security system is impenetrable.
4.4 Aggregated or Anonymized Data

We may share anonymized or aggregated data (e.g., total steps recorded across D2 users, top 10 user accounts’ stats) with potential investors, business partners, or for marketing purposes.
This does not include personally identifiable information.
5. Privacy and GDPR
5.1 GDPR Compliance

If you are located in the European Economic Area (EEA), you have certain rights under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), including the right to access, correct, and delete your data.
You can request deletion of your data from within the App or by contacting our Data Protection Officer at merlin.bergmann@karta.game.
5.2 Data Protection Officer

Our designated Data Protection Officer (DPO) is Merlin Bergmann, Product Director. You may direct any privacy-related inquiries to merlin.bergmann@karta.game.

6. Health and Medical Disclaimer
6.1 No Medical Advice

The App only provides general fitness guidance by suggesting daily step goals (e.g., referencing the World Health Organization’s general guidelines).
We do not provide medical advice, diagnoses, treatment plans, or personalized nutrition or workout plans.
Always consult with a qualified healthcare professional before making decisions about your fitness activities.

8. Account Suspension and Termination
8.1 Termination by You

You can delete your account at any time by using the in-app Manage Account settings or by contacting us at merlin.bergmann@karta.game.
Once your account is deleted, your personal data will be removed or anonymized in accordance with our data retention policies. However, your steps may remain in an aggregated, non-personally identifiable form (e.g., overall D2 step count).
8.2 Suspension or Termination by Us

We reserve the right to suspend or terminate your account if you violate these Terms, engage in fraudulent activities, or if we suspect any misuse of the App.
We may also terminate or suspend accounts deemed inactive for an extended period.

Any in-game items or rewards already granted through third-party gaming accounts are subject to the respective gaming platform’s policies.
