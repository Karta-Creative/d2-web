    <h1>D2 Health Club – Terms and Conditions</h1>
    <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> [Jan 14, 2025]</p>

    <p>
      Welcome to <strong>D2 Health Club</strong> (the "<strong>App</strong>"). This App is owned and operated by 
      <strong>KARTA CREATIVE LTD</strong>, a company registered in England and Wales with its 
      registered office at 167-169 Great Portland Street, 5th Floor, London, England, W1W 5PF 
      (referred to herein as "<strong>we</strong>," "<strong>us</strong>," or "<strong>our</strong>").
    </p>

    <p>
      By downloading, accessing, installing, or using the App, you (the "<strong>User</strong>" or "<strong>you</strong>") 
      agree to be bound by these Terms and Conditions (the "<strong>Terms</strong>"). If you do not agree with these Terms, 
      you must not use the App.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Scope of These Terms</h2>

    <h3>1.1 Acceptance of Terms</h3>
    <p>
      These Terms govern your use of the App and any associated features and services (collectively, 
      the "<strong>Services</strong>"). By using the App, you acknowledge that you have read, 
      understood, and agree to be bound by these Terms.
    </p>

    <h3>1.2 Additional Terms and Policies</h3>
    <p>
      From time to time, additional terms and conditions may apply to certain features or services 
      offered within the App. In the event of a conflict between these Terms and any additional 
      terms, the additional terms shall prevail solely with respect to the conflicting subject matter.
    </p>

    <h3>1.3 Age Requirement</h3>
    <p>
      The App is currently intended for individuals who are at least <strong>18 years of age</strong> 
      (or the age of majority in your jurisdiction). By registering for or using the App, you 
      represent that you meet this requirement. We do not actively discourage minors from downloading 
      the App, but the App is not designed or marketed for their use.
    </p>

    <h2>2. App Functionality and Beta Disclaimer</h2>

    <h3>2.1 Primary Purpose</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>The core function of the App is to help you track your daily steps and encourage 
          you to reach individually set step goals.</li>
      <li>You may connect and compare your step stats with friends on a leaderboard.</li>
      <li>You may also link the App to certain gaming accounts so you can occasionally receive 
          in-game rewards—such as items or boosts—if you achieve specific step goals or 
          maintain streaks.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2.2 Individual Use and Friends Integration</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>The App is designed primarily for individual use but also allows you to connect 
          with friends and compare step data.</li>
      <li>There is currently <strong>no</strong> feature for posting user-generated content 
          (e.g., photos, forum posts, comments).</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2.3 Beta Status</h3>
    <p>
      The App is in an <strong>early closed beta</strong> stage. Features may change, and 
      there may be bugs, errors, or interruptions in service. We reserve the right to modify 
      or discontinue the App (or any part of it) without prior notice.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Third-Party Integrations and In-Game Rewards</h2>

    <h3>3.1 Step Data Sources</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>The App retrieves step counts from third-party health platforms, such as Apple Health (iOS) 
          and Google Health Connect (Android).</li>
      <li>We do not guarantee the accuracy or reliability of data from these third-party sources.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>3.2 Gaming Accounts and Rewards</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>In order to receive sporadic in-game rewards, you may connect your gaming account(s) 
          to the App.</li>
      <li>We are <strong>not</strong> responsible for any issues related to those third-party 
          gaming platforms, including their own terms of service, reward availability, or the 
          crediting of rewards to your gaming account.</li>
      <li>Rewards are not guaranteed and may vary based on your location, your step activity, 
          partnership arrangements, or other factors.</li>
