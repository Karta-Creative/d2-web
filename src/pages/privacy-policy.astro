    <p>
      Welcome to <strong>D2 Health Club</strong> (the "App"), owned and operated
      by
      <strong>KARTA CREATIVE LTD</strong> (also referred to as "D2 Health Club" or
      "Karta Creative Ltd"). We value your privacy and are committed to protecting
      your personal information. This Privacy Policy explains how we access, collect,
      use, share, retain, and protect your data when you use our App.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl text-d2-teal font-bold">1. Data We Collect</h2>
    <h3 class="text-xl text-d2-teal font-bold">1.1 Personal Information</h3>
    <p>
      We collect your <strong>email address</strong> and a unique <strong
        >user ID</strong
      > generated during account creation. This information is essential for authentication,
      account management, and delivering personalized features such as step tracking
      and leaderboards. Data collection for account creation and management is required
      and cannot be disabled without deleting your account.
    </p>

    <h3 class="text-xl text-d2-teal font-bold">1.2 Health and Fitness Data</h3>
    <p>
      The App collects your <strong>daily step goal</strong>, <strong
        >daily step count</strong
      >, and <strong>total steps</strong> since registration. This fitness data is
      necessary to provide the core functionality of the App, including accurate
      step tracking, personalized progress displays, and leaderboard features.
    </p>

    <h3 class="text-xl text-d2-teal font-bold">1.3 Gaming Account Data</h3>
    <p>
      If you connect your gaming account (e.g., Roblox) to receive in-game
      rewards, we collect your <strong>Roblox account ID</strong> to verify eligibility
      and deliver rewards.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl text-d2-teal font-bold">2. How We Use Your Data</h2>
    <p>We use your data to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Enable essential App functionality, such as account creation,
        authentication, and personalized step tracking.
      </li>
      <li>Display real-time step counts and manage leaderboards.</li>
      <li>Facilitate in-game rewards when you connect your gaming account.</li>

    <h2 class="text-2xl text-d2-teal font-bold">3. Data Security</h2>
    <p>
      All data transmitted from your device is encrypted in transit using
      industry-standard protocols (e.g., HTTPS). We use <strong>Supabase</strong
      > for database and authentication, and access to your data is restricted to
      authorized personnel only. Although we employ robust security measures, no
      system is completely secure.
    </p>

      4. Data Retention and Deletion
    </h2>

      We retain your personal data only as long as necessary to provide our
      services or as required by law. Your data remains in our active systems
      while your account is active. When you request deletion of your account,
      your personal data is permanently removed from our active systems.
      However, aggregated or anonymized data may be retained for analytical and
      business purposes.
    </p>

      fitness (step count) data—is essential for providing core App
      functionality and account management. This data is transmitted off your

      necessary to deliver our services.
