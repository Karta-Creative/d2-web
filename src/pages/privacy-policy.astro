    <h1>D2 Health Club â€“ Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Last Updated: [Jan 14, 2025]</strong></p>

    <p>
      Welcome to <strong>D2 Health Club</strong> (the "<strong>App</strong>"),
      owned and operated by
      <strong>KARTA CREATIVE LTD</strong> ("<strong>we</strong>", "<strong
        >us</strong
      >", or "<strong>our</strong>"). We value your privacy and are committed to
      protecting your personal information. This Privacy Policy explains how we
      collect, use, share, and protect your data when you use our App.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Data We Collect</h2>
    <h3>2.1 Personal Data</h3>
    <p>
      We collect your <strong>email address</strong> to create and manage your user
      account. We do not collect other personal details such as full name, date of
      birth, or phone number. We also do not collect any location data (precise or
      approximate).
    </p>

    <h3>2.2 Health and Fitness Data</h3>
    <p>
      The App tracks your <strong>daily step goal</strong>, <strong
        >daily step count</strong
      >, and <strong>total steps</strong> since registering. We do not collect other
      health metrics such as calorie burn, distance traveled, or heart rate.
    </p>

    <h3>2.3 Gaming Account Data</h3>
    <p>
      If you connect your gaming account (e.g., Roblox) to receive in-game
      rewards, we collect your <strong>Roblox account ID</strong> to verify eligibility
      and deliver rewards. We do not store any other gaming platform credentials,
      though the authentication process may occur via Apple, Discord, or Roblox.
    </p>

    <h3>3. How We Use Your Data</h3>
    <p>We primarily use your data to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Provide core App functions, such as displaying step counts and
        leaderboards.
      </li>
      <li>
        Allow you to connect your gaming account and receive in-game rewards
        (via Roblox ID).
      </li>
      <li>
        Maintain and improve the App (e.g., address bugs or performance issues).
      </li>
      <li>
        Communicate with you regarding updates or changes to our services.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Data Security</h2>
    <p>
      We use <strong>Supabase</strong> for database and authentication, which employs
      industry-standard security protocols. Access to user data is restricted to
      our senior technical team members. We also use common security measures to
      safeguard data in transit (e.g., HTTPS) and at rest (e.g., encryption at the
      service provider level). While we strive to protect your data, no method of
      data transmission or storage is completely secure, and we cannot guarantee
      absolute security.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Your Rights</h2>
    <p>Depending on your jurisdiction, you may have the right to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Access your personal data.</li>
      <li>Request correction of inaccurate or incomplete data.</li>
      <li>Request deletion of your personal data.</li>
      <li>Object to or restrict certain types of data processing.</li>
      <li>Request data portability.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      To exercise your rights under GDPR, CCPA, or other applicable laws, please
      email
      <strong>support@d2health.club</strong>. We also provide an in-app account
      deletion option that automatically deletes your associated data.
