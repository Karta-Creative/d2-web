    <h1>D2 Health Club – Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Last Updated: [Jan 14, 2025]</strong></p>

    <p>
      Welcome to <strong>D2 Health Club</strong> (the "<strong>App</strong>"), owned and operated by 
      <strong>KARTA CREATIVE LTD</strong> ("<strong>we</strong>," "<strong>us</strong>," or 
      "<strong>our</strong>"). We value your privacy and are committed to protecting your 
      personal information. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, share, and protect 
      your data when you use our App.
    </p>

    <p>
      Our legal bases for processing your data typically include: <strong>user consent</strong> (e.g., 
      agreeing to this Privacy Policy and creating an account) and <strong>contractual necessity</strong> 
      (e.g., to provide core App services such as step tracking and in-game rewards).
    </p>

    <h2>2. Data We Collect</h2>

    <h3>2.1 Personal Data</h3>
    <p>
      We collect your <strong>email address</strong> to create and manage your user account. 
      We do not collect other personal details such as full name, date of birth, or phone number. 
      We also do not collect any location data (precise or approximate).
    </p>

    <h3>2.2 Health and Fitness Data</h3>
    <p>
      The App tracks your <strong>daily step goal</strong>, <strong>daily step count</strong>, 
      and <strong>total steps</strong> since registering. We do not collect other health metrics 
      such as calorie burn, distance traveled, or heart rate.
    </p>

    <h3>2.3 Gaming Account Data</h3>
    <p>
      If you connect your gaming account (e.g., Roblox) to receive in-game rewards, we collect 
      your <strong>Roblox account ID</strong> to verify eligibility and deliver rewards. 
      We do not store any other gaming platform credentials, though the authentication process 
      may occur via Apple, Discord, or Roblox.
    </p>

    <h3>2.4 Device and Usage Data</h3>
    <p>
      We do <strong>not</strong> currently store any device information (e.g., IP address, 
      operating system) or in-app usage analytics (e.g., screen views, time spent). However, 
      certain runtime operations may require standard device data for the App to function 
      (e.g., for authentication or connecting to third parties), which is not stored in our 
      database.
    </p>

    <h3>2.5 Cookies or Similar Technologies</h3>
    <p>
      We do not directly use cookies, tracking pixels, or SDKs to collect user behavior data 
      within the App. However, when you authenticate using Apple, Discord, or Roblox, those 
      third-party platforms may process your information according to their own privacy 
      practices.
    </p>

    <h2>3. How We Use Your Data</h2>
    <p>
      We primarily use your data to:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Provide core App functions, such as displaying step counts and leaderboards.</li>
      <li>Allow you to connect your gaming account and receive in-game rewards (via Roblox ID).</li>
      <li>Maintain and improve the App (e.g., address bugs or performance issues).</li>
      <li>Communicate with you regarding updates or changes to our services (if relevant in the future).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      We do not currently send marketing emails or push notifications based on your data or 
      behavior, nor do we run remarketing or retargeting campaigns with user data.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Data Sharing and Disclosure</h2>

    <h3>4.1 Aggregated Data</h3>
    <p>
      We may share <strong>aggregated</strong> or <strong>anonymized</strong> step data (e.g., total 
      number of steps recorded by users, anonymized stats for top users, or aggregated streak 
      data) with potential investors, business partners, or for general promotional materials.
    </p>

    <h3>4.2 Non-Aggregated Data</h3>
    <p>
      We do <strong>not</strong> sell, rent, or trade personal data to third parties. However, we 
      may disclose non-aggregated personal data in limited circumstances:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>To comply with legal obligations or respond to valid legal processes (e.g., law 
          enforcement requests).</li>
      <li>In the event of a merger, acquisition, or other business transaction where user 
          information may be transferred as part of the assets.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>4.3 International Transfers</h3>
    <p>
      Our servers are hosted in the <strong>EU</strong>, and we strive to keep your data within 
      the EEA. However, certain team members or gaming partners may be located outside the EU/EEA. 
      In such cases, we take reasonable measures to ensure an adequate level of data protection, 
      such as using Standard Contractual Clauses or equivalent mechanisms when necessary.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Data Retention</h2>
    <p>
      We retain your personal data as long as your account remains active. If you request 
      account deletion, we will delete your data (including step history) unless we have a 
      lawful basis to keep it (e.g., aggregated or anonymized data for analytics). We may also 
      periodically delete inactive accounts or associated data to manage storage costs, in 
      line with our internal policies.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Data Security</h2>
    <p>
      We use <strong>Supabase</strong> for database and authentication, which employs 
      industry-standard security protocols. Access to user data is restricted to our senior 
      technical team members. We also use common security measures to safeguard data in transit 
      (e.g., HTTPS) and at rest (e.g., encryption at the service provider level). While we 
      strive to protect your data, no method of data transmission or storage is completely 
      secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.
    </p>

    <h3>6.1 Breach Notification</h3>
    <p>
      In the event of a data breach, we will promptly investigate and take appropriate 
      remedial actions. Where required by law, we will notify affected users and relevant 
      authorities in accordance with applicable regulations.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Your Rights</h2>
    <p>
      Depending on your jurisdiction, you may have the right to:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Access your personal data.</li>
      <li>Request correction of inaccurate or incomplete data.</li>
      <li>Request deletion of your personal data.</li>
      <li>Object to or restrict certain types of data processing.</li>
      <li>Request data portability.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      To exercise your rights under GDPR, CCPA, or other applicable laws, please email 
      <strong>merlin.bergmann@karta.game</strong>. We also provide an in-app account deletion 
      option that automatically deletes your associated data.
    </p>

    <h2>8. Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>
      The App is designed for adults (18+). We do not knowingly collect or solicit personal 
      information from minors. If you believe a minor has provided us with personal 
      information, please contact us at <strong>merlin.bergmann@karta.game</strong>, and we 
      will take steps to delete the information as soon as possible.
    </p>

    <h2>9. Updates to This Policy</h2>
    <p>
      We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices, 
      technology, or legal requirements. When we do, we will post the revised Policy and, if 
      necessary, notify you via email, in-app banner, or push notification. The "Last Updated" 
      date at the top indicates when the latest changes were made.
    </p>
